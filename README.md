## Getting Started

### Features

- An enterprise-class UI design system for web applications.
- A set of high-quality React components out of the box.
- Written in TypeScript with predictable static types.
- The whole package of development and design resources and tools.

###  Environment Support

* Modern browsers
* Server-side Rendering

### Install

```bash
npm install ko-ui --save
```

Before the building, you need a style theme, here we recommend you to pick up `ko-theme`.

```bash
npm install ko-theme --save
```
### Usage

We are die hard fans of ECMAScript 6, so we recommend you writing code in modern javascript.

```js
import { Button } from 'ko-ui';
```
